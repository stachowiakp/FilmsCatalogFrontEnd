# FilmsCatalogFrontEnd
FilmsCatalogFrontEnd is really simple project, which allowed me to deep dive into .NET Core and ASP.NET Core frameworks and learn them with on-hands experience.
Project was build around business of ficional cinema. It allows cinema managers to manage films in playlist and client reservations for those films.
This project was build for easier usage of other project (FilmsCatalogAPI). It has frontend website with all features allowing the usage of REST API methods build in mentioned project.
Project was build using ASP.NET Core.
There is related repository of mentioned project (link below) with REST API managing films and reservations databases.
There will be online demo of combined projects (frontend and backend) available soon.
